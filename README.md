# Blazor WebAssemby Hosted with SSR and TailwindCSS

This is a minimal template for an empty .NET 6.0 Blazor WebAssembly Hosted with Server-Side Rendering and TailwindCSS.

TailwindCSS is added in the build actions of ``BlazorSSR.Client.csproj``, using ``npm`` and ``npx`` to generate the TailwindCSS classes.
